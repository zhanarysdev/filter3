        <p>
          <table></table> Users have given their consent for one or more
          specific purposes.

          legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal
          basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the
          provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement,
          or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
        </p>
        <h3>Further information about retention time</h3>
        <p>
          Unless specified otherwise in this document, Personal Data shall be
          processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have
          been collected for and may be retained for longer due to applicable

          the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant
          sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period
          whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as
          such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged
          to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to
          fulfil a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
          Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to
          rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
          after expiration of the retention period.
