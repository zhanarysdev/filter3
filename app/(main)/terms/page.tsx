            We reserve the right to change the Filter subscription price or
            Filter subscription period from time to time (or to enable
            Influencers to do the same). We may disable auto-renewal for some or
            all Filter Subscriptions in our sole discretion. We will provide you
            with notice of any such changes and they will apply to you no
            earlier than your next renewal.

            When you purchase a Filter’s subscription through a Third-Party

            Third-Party Platform Provider in accordance with the terms disclosed
            to you at the time of purchase and all terms applicable to your use
            of that Third-Party Platform Provider.

            accordance with the policies of your
          </p>
          <p>
            Third-Party Platform Provider. To cancel your Filter Subscription,
            you may visit either the Creator&#39;s profile or the
            &quot;Subscriptions&quot; tabs in your Settings, both of which will
            connect you to the subscription management features of your
            Third-Party Platform Provider. You may also cancel your Filter
            Subscription directly through the Third-Party Platform Provider. For
            some Third-Party Platform Providers, you may need to cancel your
            Filter Subscription 24 hours before the end of the current
            subscription period to prevent the FIlter Subscription from being
            automatically renewed.
          </p>
          <p>When you purchase a Filter Subscription, you agree:</p>
          <p>
            (a) we will provide you with access to your Filter Subscription
            immediately; and (b) you waive any statutory right you might have to
            change your mind about your Filter Subscription and receive a refund
            within the applicable cooling off period. Because you agree to
            access the Filter Subscription immediately and waive your statutory
            right to change your mind in the cooling off period, you cannot
            exercise your statutory right to cancel and receive a refund within
            the cooling off period. By starting a Filter Subscription, you
            understand that the Creator to whose Filter Subscription you have
            subscribed can receive information about your engagement with the
            Creator&#39;s Filter Subscription as set out in our Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree and understand that Filter does not have any editorial
            control over, nor responsibility for, any Filter Subscription
            Content. Use of Filter Subscriptions is at your sole discretion.

            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Continued use of Filter Subscriptions requires an active Filter
            account. If you delete your FIlter account, you will lose access to
            any content obtained through Filter Subscriptions. Your purchase may
            also be subject to additional terms for the Third-Party Platform
            Provider you use.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to update these Filter Subscription Fan Terms
            from time to time and your continued use of Filter Subscriptions
            constitutes acceptance of those changes. If any change to these
            Filter Subscription Fan Terms will materially disadvantage you, or
            materially affect the availability of the Filter Subscription, we
            will provide you with notice before the changes become effective and
            you can choose to cancel your Filter Subscription. Your continued
            use of FIlter Subscriptions constitutes acceptance of those changes.

            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            You also acknowledge that either we or any Influencer may change the
            features or content available to you as part of your Filter
            Subscription(s) from time to time, including during a billing
            period. If you do not wish to continue your Filter Subscription as a
            result of any such change then you should cancel it before you are
            committed to the next billing period. Your continued use of Filter
            Subscriptions and/or renewal for a further billing period
            constitutes acceptance of those changes.

            You agree not to make available creations or otherwise make posts on
            Filter that infringe others’ intellectual property or proprietary
            rights. Filter reserves the right to remove creations and other
            material that violate Filter’s terms and policies, including these
            Terms of Use. We respond to complaint notifications of claimed
            copyright infringement and have adopted and reasonably implemented a
            policy for terminating, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts
            of creators and patrons who are the subject of repeated compliant
            notifications of claimed copyright infringement or other evidence
            that suggests a pattern of repeat infringement.
